    <h2>No Longer A House Divided</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Any modern web design process requires intense collaboration between designers and front-end developers</p>

        <p>This collaboration and empathy between disciplines are just as important as the techniques, methods and
            development frameworks used to take apart a problem.</p>

        <p>We need to know each other tools</p>

        <p>Developers should be able to understand a layout, having a detailed knowledge of it and designers should have an idea of what the rules of the house are.</p>

        <p>When a feature requires a layout change or when we need to build a new section, layout needs to be understood by both designers and developers</p>

    <h3>What can be done now with grids</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The grid system is ready</li>
        <li>Can be used safely for every little and big feature</li>
        <li>It's easy to refactor our code using mixins</li>
        <li>Great integration with Bootstrap's responsive utilities, ex
        <ul>
            <li>.visible-xs-*</li>
            <li>.hidden-sm-*</li>
            <li>.visible-*-inline-block</li>
        </ul></li>

    </ul>

        <p>We "correct" our layouts with semantic class names and we play with mixins</p>

        <p>When a feature requires a layout change or when we need to build a new section, layout needs to be understood by both designers and developers</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>This at first is complex for every designer. They have to start dealing with the necessary content at the smallest resolutions with the absolute bare essential available.</p>

        <p>It's tricky and it has constrains but the big PRO is that, from a super lean, essential yet complete project we can gradually “enhance” it and even completely
            rethink it for larger platforms with fewer constraints</p>

        <p>Graceful degradation is still doable because of the controlled environment that we have.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based
            grids, flexible images and CSS3 media queries.</p>
