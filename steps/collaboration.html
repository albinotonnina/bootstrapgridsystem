    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Any modern web design process requires intense collaboration between designers and front-end developers</p>

        <p>This collaboration and empathy between disciplines are just as important as the techniques, methods and
            development frameworks used to take apart a problem.</p>

        <p>We need to know each other tools</p>

        <p>Developers should be able to understand a layout, having a detailed knowledge of it and designers should have an idea of what the rules of the house are.</p>

    <h2>What can be done now with grids</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The grid system has always been available</li>
        <li>Can be safely used for each little new feature</li>
        <li>It's easy to refactor our code with mixins</li>

    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>We "correct" our layouts with semantic class names and we play with mixins</p>
        <p>When a feature requires a layout change or when we need to build a new section, layout needs to be understood by both designers and developers</p>

        <p>A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based
            grids, flexible images and CSS3 media queries.</p>
