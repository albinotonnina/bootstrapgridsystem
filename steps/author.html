    <aside class="notes">
        <p>I'm a frontend developer here but I've been called also a web master, a web designer, a web developer, a frontend designer...</p>
        <p>I produced work using almost every major technique ever tried or experimented for the web. From websites made of tables to scrolling liquid parallaxed single page layouts, and everything
            else in the middle </p>
        <p>I worked as a freelance and as an employee in small and big companies. But most of the time I've been an entrepreneur. </p>
        <p>That forced me to be constantly in direct contact with my clients and thankfully with the users of my products.</p>
        <p>I also had the chance to play almost every role in the process. I think I learned a lot.</p>
