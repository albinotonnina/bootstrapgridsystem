    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Pretend you are in constructions, a builder working on the outside of the building.</p>
        <p>We need to do it from scratch, choose how many doors and windows, how big, how small, where to install the plumbing, the colors, the materials, you get the idea.</p>
        <p>You have to choose between two workplaces, you have the same tasks.</p>

        <p>Guess what, the scaffolding is where we need to work.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of websites and applications use a grid. There might be not an explicit grid system in place
            but
            a simple two-column layout with a sidebar and a main content area is already a grid.</p>
        <p>What those websites and application do is actually re-invent a new grid system around the product. This works.</p>
        <p>But, when the layout has to evolve and we need to add complexity, it's not easy to maintain the initial stability. The grid becomes unreliable. We need to modify it on the fly.</p>

        <p>Grid frameworks such as Bootstrap's grid system are there to manage more complex layouts. </p>
        <p>They also help when we need to work with complex environments, such SPA.</p>

        <p>A grid system should be a structure at the lower levels of the layout in the optics of a modular scalable architecture for our HTML and CSS (SMACSS)</p>
        <p>It means that should never be altered when composing and evolving the layout.</p>

    <h2>The grid is the mannequin and the comp is the pattern.</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Working with grids allows designers and developers to easily communicate and understand how to put layouts
            together. It provides developers with units of measurement that they can easily turn into divs.</p>

        <p>It also informs both sides how to layout elements on a page so that they can transition between different devices, mobile and
            desktop etc.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of grid frameworks</h2>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Visual harmony</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>A balanced and consistently implemented design scheme will increase readers’
            confidence</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Provides coherence to complexity</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Easy maintenance</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Communication developers/designers, smoother workflow</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Responsive design</h3></li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>The goal is to establish a consistent, logical screen layout, one that allows us to “plug in” text and
            graphics without having to stop and rethink our basic design approach on each new page.</p>

        <p>coherence to complexity: it's a matter of counting until 12.</p>

        <p>easy maintenance: it's outside our code but always available.</p>

        <p>communication: we sometimes communicate to each other with two slightly different unit of measurements, that
            leads to misunderstandings or pitfalls.</p>
