        <p>You are in constructions, a builder working with scaffolding...</p>

        <p>The vast majority of websites and applications use a grid. There may be not an explicit grid system in place
            but
            a simple two-column layout with a sidebar and a main content area is already a grid.</p>

        <p>We actually invent a new grid system around the product. When the layout changes a bit though, sometimes it's
            not easy to maintain the initial stability.</p>

        <p>Grid frameworks such as Bootstrap's grid system are there to manage a more complex layouts</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>Working with grids allows designers and programmers to easily communicate and understand how to put webpages
            together. It provides developers with units of measurement that they can easily turn into divs.</p>

        <p>It also informs both sides how to layout elements on a page so that they can transition between mobile and
            desktop.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of grid frameworks</h2>

    <ul>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Visual harmony</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>A balanced and consistently implemented design scheme will increase readers’
            confidence</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Provides coherence to complexity</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Easy maintenance</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Communication developers/designers, smoother workflow</h3></li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in"><h3>Responsive design</h3></li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>The goal is to establish a consistent, logical screen layout, one that allows us to “plug in” text and
            graphics without having to stop and rethink our basic design approach on each new page.</p>

        <p>coherence to complexity: it's a matter of counting until 12.</p>

        <p>easy maintenance: it's outside our code but always available.</p>

        <p>communication: we sometimes communicate to each other with two slightly different unit of measurements, that
            leads to misunderstandings or pitfalls.</p>
